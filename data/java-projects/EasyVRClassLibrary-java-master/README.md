# EasyVRClassLibrary-java
Java port of the EasyVR class library by RoboTech-srl
This is a port of the Arduino library available at https://github.com/RoboTech-srl/EasyVR-Arduino 
included are some unit tests and a simple test harness that uses the library port to do some basic 
recognition and return some information from the module.

If you are new to using the Easy VR module, I recommend you install Easy VR commander (http://www.veear.eu/downloads/) 
and also a copy of Termite (https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm) - 
Easy VR Commander provides a means of configuring your module and can help verify your code is working. 
Termite is a simple but effective serial terminal for debugging your interactions with the module via the serial port.
